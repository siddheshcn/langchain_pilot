# Episode 11- Beyond Medicine- How Emotional Intelligence Elevates Doctors in an AI World**

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** When all things are equal, when intelligence is equal again, and AI levels the playing field, what separates you from being just a good, typical doctor and an extraordinary doctor, the one that we’re all looking to be, will be the ability to communicate in an effective manner—not just communicate, but effectively.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** Welcome to the *Business of AI in Healthcare* podcast. I’m your host, Dr. Bob Kaiser. Our mission is to discuss practical insights and share knowledge on how to navigate the transformative technology of AI. It’s important to understand how AI can be used safely and ethically while revolutionizing patient care, streamlining operations, and enhancing medical research.

I have long anticipated the opportunity to interview today’s guest for the *Business of AI in Healthcare* podcast. I seldom make a guarantee, but I will today. I guarantee after listening to this interview, you will think differently about yourself. And by doing so, you will think and act differently toward others.

We’re delighted to welcome neurosurgeon, investor, and author, Dr. Nimesh Patel. Welcome, Nimesh. **Dr. Nimesh Patel:**

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** Thank you, Bob. Thank you. And you’re right. I think after this conversation, those who are listening will have a different perspective, something meaningful to them and worthwhile. So I appreciate the opportunity. Always great to see you and speak with you.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** Well, let me review once again: neurosurgeon, MD, investor, MBA, and author—soon-to-be celebrated laureate. So for our audience, we want to discuss your recent book, *Extraordinary Doctor.* And for our audience, don’t think for a minute that we’re discussing advanced medical technology. It’s something much more important—how emotional intelligence drives success. So, Nimesh, why this book and why now?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** Yeah, I think that’s a great question. You know, in the world that we live in today, Bob, when we’re speaking to either high-performance physicians or high-performance leaders in other industries, at some point in time, IQ skills get replaced by AI, or they get replaced by something else. What gives a competitive advantage to the individual to progress is the EQ skills and people skills.

And what I’ll say is this book is geared toward young doctors and those who want to be in leadership, but it also focuses on other industry groups. No one taught me unless you had someone, a mentor, or an apprenticeship, that someone taught you how to behave in certain situations to your advantage. That’s very difficult to learn. What I’ve done in this book is take nearly two decades of healthcare experience. I’ve lived in the healthcare world that long, and I’ve seen things like, “Gosh, I wish someone had told me that before,” and I would have implemented it early on. That’s where the book comes from. It’s a very tactical, very practical book that can be applied very quickly for individuals who don’t have a lot of time.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** Well, I’m going to get into a lot of the details on the book because I’ve read it thoroughly. I’ve actually read it twice. You had me on page one. That’s right—many of these books make you wonder what it’s all about, but on page one, you got my attention. I’ll try to set up the situation and then hand this topic back to you.

For the benefit of our audience, this is a journey of medical education. You have four years of undergraduate studies, like most people, then four years of medical school, with Step 1 and Step 2 exams tucked in there. Then you have a resident matching, five years of surgical residency, maybe two more years of fellowship. You end up with about 15 years of competitive learning. So, Nimesh, start on page one of *Extraordinary Doctor* with the phone call. Start there, if you would.

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** I think page one—without giving it all away—is a very vulnerable piece that I have tucked away for many years. And I’m speaking to all my high achievers out there. There are things that we will never share with anyone because it’s just too painful to talk about. It’s a failure episode. At this point in time in my career, in my last year of medical school, I had done everything you need to do. I had checked the boxes with grades, done the rotations, spoken to the professors, and interviewed well. Everyone set me up. I was confident that I would move into the next part of my career, which was to become a neurosurgical resident. What happened was just the opposite. I got the phone call that morning, and I thought it was a joke. I couldn’t believe it. I sat down, completely destroyed—everything I had ever built up. It was a soul-searching moment. Looking back now, 20+ years later, it was a defining moment in my career. If I had not done what I did—picked myself up, barely making it—I would not be where I am today.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** So what happened? What’s this resident matching all about?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** As you eloquently put it, after medical school, you need an apprenticeship—that’s residency training. Each branch of medicine has a certain amount of time for training. For neurosurgeons, it’s six to seven years, sometimes more. That’s where you learn to eat, drink, and sleep the specialty. For me, it was neurosurgery. In order to be accepted into such a competitive residency, you have to do things to make yourself stand out. I had done those things. When I didn’t cross the bar—didn’t make the cut—I slipped, fell, and skinned my knees. It was a tough time, but I had to pick up. And what I did from there…

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** Yeah, save some of that for the book because that got me hooked right away. I couldn’t stop there. I had to keep going. So, we’ll let them discover more of how you remedied that situation. Sound fair?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** Sounds fair. What I’m saying is, all of us have been through this process. When you read this, put yourself in that position and know you’re not alone. There are other people out there, seemingly successful or still trying to become what they aspire to be, but they’ve tripped and fallen as well. I share that story to say, “Hey, we’re going to do this together.”

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** Well, I need to share this with you. Hearing your story and how you overcame it made me reflect. I missed my match too—not a residency match, but a job match that I really wanted. Back in 1975, when I was getting out of engineering school, jobs in engineering were hard to get. People at Boeing were driving taxis because there weren’t enough engineering jobs. I applied for this job, knowing I would get it, and I didn’t. I called back—this was when you sent letters, no email—and said, “I need to revisit this.” I went back to the company. They liked my persistence and gave me another chance to interview. The people I interviewed with were all sick that day, and I didn’t feel like I got a fair shot. But I hung in there. Just like you, it helped change my path and shaped my attitude to advance confidently. So, like you said, everyone has a story, and the vulnerability you expressed is bold. Most people don’t do that, but it’s a great leadership quality.

You mentioned that after 15 years of brain surgery and dealing with grim outcomes like glioblastoma, your emotions shifted from being about science and sympathizing to offering understanding to your patients. You say this is the power to make an ordinary doctor extraordinary. What do you mean by offering understanding to your patients?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** You’re right. I think when you start your profession, especially as a doctor, new doctors are often driven by the challenge—the ability to diagnose, to figure out the problem, and fix it. That becomes the mindset for many years. But at some point, you realize you can’t always change the outcome. There are situations where it’s simply not in your power. You can help improve things, but you can’t change the science of what’s happening to the patient or their family. In those cases, we, as physicians, have a duty to move from sympathy to empathy. It’s about putting yourself in their shoes, even just for a moment, to understand what they’re feeling. That skill—being able to connect in that way with a patient or family member during a dire situation—can make a monumental difference in how they face the challenges ahead.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** I want to hear more about some of the topics you’ve highlighted in *The Extraordinary Doctor.* Like you said, the theme is discovering essential people skills that you didn’t learn in medical school. So, I’m a little puzzled. Is there something about doctors in general that puts them at a disadvantage in effectively communicating and practicing these essential people skills? Does all this competitive education hinder that?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** How many times have you heard someone say, “I love my doctor. They’re not the most personable, but they’re the best”? It happens a lot. When you devote yourself to mastering a skill like medicine, you often do so at the sacrifice of other skills—like connecting with people. Whether you’re a high-performance athlete, a Navy SEAL, or a doctor, it comes at the cost of learning those interpersonal skills because there’s just no time for it. But once you’re out in the real world, the rules are different. It’s not just about technical skills anymore. Yes, technical skills will get you far, but what separates the ordinary from the extraordinary is the ability to connect with people and get the job done.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** The theme here is communication, and we both agree it’s an essential emotional intelligence skill. In your book, you mention some really good prescriptive advice on word choice, like using the word *and* instead of *but.* How does that make a difference in communication?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** There are about five stories in the book where communication was framed with “you did this, but…” When someone says *but*, it immediately puts the other person in a defensive position, making them feel like they didn’t do well enough. Instead of using *but*, use *and*. It softens the delivery and helps keep the conversation going.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** Right—*and* adds to the conversation, instead of stopping it like *but* does. For example, instead of saying, “You’re going to be a good swimmer, but you didn’t use your stroke right,” you’d say, “You’re going to be a good swimmer, and you can improve your stroke as well.”

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** Exactly right. *But* halts the conversation, while *and* allows it to continue.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** You also mention other phrases, like, “I have found that…” as a way to offer suggestions without sounding like a hard rule or opinion. Can you expand on that?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** When you’re mentoring a colleague or mentee, it’s often difficult to have them understand a new technique if they’ve been taught a different way. Instead of telling them outright what to do, which might put them on the defensive, saying “I have found that…” makes it more of a suggestion. It plants a seed in their mind for future consideration without offending their previous training or beliefs.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** That’s amazing—the choice of words can make such a difference. You also mentioned in the book that some phrases, like “It’s the right thing to do,” can backfire. Why is that?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** It’s a common phrase in our field, “I want to do this because it’s the right thing to do.” But when someone hears that, it can imply that their idea wasn’t good enough or was wrong. It can shut down the conversation instead of allowing it to move forward.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** You have a lot of examples in the book that coach readers on better communication, but here’s the big question: How do you make yourself aware of better word choices? After a conversation, you might think, “I should have said *and* instead of *but*, or avoided saying *it’s the right thing to do*.” How do you condition yourself to be more aware of better word choices?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** You’ve already hit on it—you need to be aware. Once you’re aware of the impact your words can have, you can start collecting phrases or sentences that work well and store them in your back pocket. Over time, using those phrases becomes instinctual. It’s like any skill—you practice until it becomes second nature.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** So, it’s a conditioning process you can learn?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** That’s right.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** You refer to the amygdala being hijacked, and our audience may not be familiar with that. As a neurosurgeon, can you briefly explain how to anticipate and deal with amygdala hijacking?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** The amygdala is the emotional hub of our brain—it’s responsible for fight or flight. When we perceive a threat, the amygdala activates, and we either fight or run away. The frontal lobe, or the CEO of the brain, is responsible for rational decision-making. In stressful situations, if the frontal lobe doesn’t keep the amygdala in check, we might say or do things we regret. That’s what happens when the amygdala is hijacked.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** You mention box breathing as a technique to manage stress. I tried it while reading the book, and it really settled me down. It’s like telling kids to take a deep breath when they’re upset. Box breathing does that for adults. You’ve done a great job covering many aspects of personal development in the book—whether it’s building trust, teaching, mentoring, or investing in relationships. It’s made me reflect on my past, and I’m not even a physician. This book helps many people, not just doctors. So, I want to shift the topic a bit to include emotional intelligence and how it relates to AI.

You mention in the book that doctors can become so fascinated with science that they forget the human aspect—that they’re treating patients and families. It reminds me of when the internet first came about, and “Dr. Google” became a thing. Now it’s evolved into “Dr. AI.” How do you address this next evolution of education, with respect to technology and emotional intelligence?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** Emotional intelligence has made the general population more aware. As doctors, we need to understand that patients come in with knowledge from Dr. Google or other sources. Our job as physicians is to be the authority, but that doesn’t mean we need to be authoritarian. We should acknowledge the research they’ve done, commend them for it, and then guide them with our expertise. I talk about how to do this in the book. An educated patient is an empowered patient, and that reduces a lot of anxiety for both the patient and their family.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** Where do you see AI finding its place in helping with the types of problems you deal with as a neurosurgeon?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** AI is a fantastic tool when used properly. It allows us to collect, disseminate, and quickly educate ourselves and the general population. However, as I said earlier, at some point, everyone will be able to access and interpret their own data through AI. What will set doctors apart is our ability to connect that information to the patient’s emotions and anxieties and help them synthesize what it means to them. That’s an art form that isn’t fully discussed yet, but it’s crucial. When AI levels the playing field in terms of knowledge, what will separate good doctors from extraordinary ones is the ability to communicate effectively and connect emotionally.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** Are newer doctors getting exposure to AI? Do you see it becoming a part of medical education?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** Yes, AI is already a part of medical records, and big companies are using it. It’s here to stay. But what matters is how we interpret and communicate the results to our patients. AI will never replace the liability a physician carries. Our job will always be to tell the truth and communicate that truth effectively.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** Back to the book, I found myself growing through self-reflection. It helped me better understand who I am and who I can become. *The Extraordinary Doctor* emphasizes the importance of being authentic, vulnerable, accepting other people’s ideas, being present, and understanding others. These qualities are essential for anyone striving to be extraordinary, not just doctors. My opinion on this book is that it’s a guidebook for professionals across all fields, not just for those who wear white coats. It’s an outstanding product. So, any final words from you, Nimesh?

**Dr. Nimesh Patel:** Thank you, Bob. You’re right—at the end of the day, I’m a neurosurgeon, and what I do, along with my colleagues, is high stakes. There’s a lot of pressure. The book is a performance book—it’s not just a feel-good book. It’s written to help you become a better version of yourself, whether you’re in medicine or another high-performance field. My goal is to make you better and help you reach your full potential. The book is written with that in mind, and I think readers will enjoy it, whether they’re in medicine or not. For those in medicine, my goal is to get this book into medical school curriculums. I’ve spoken to medical students, and while there are some resources out there, nothing is as practical as this. If someone had told me these things when I was younger, I would have been a better version of myself. I’m still a work in progress, but this book is not just what I wish I had known—it’s about the doctor I aspire to be remembered as.

**Dr. Bob Kaiser:** My suggestion, and how I plan to use the book, is to give it to a group of physicians, have them read it, and then pull them together for a two-hour discussion. It would make for a great case study, as there are so many stimulating ideas in the book. If you’re doing a short course or continuing medical education on emotional intelligence, this book will carry the conversation. I think it will make a big difference in people. Thank you, Nimesh.
